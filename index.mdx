Ingestor is the fastest way to turn messy, unstructured documents into clean, structured data, ready for your database, search, or GenAI applications.

Building a robust document ingestion pipeline is hard. Extracting accurate data from PDFs, scans, emails, and other formats involves complex OCR, handling edge cases, and cleaning up low-quality or inconsistent input. Many teams spend months of engineering time building and maintaining these pipelines, only to run into new challenges as requirements grow.

**Ingestor solves this for you.**  
Just send any document to our simple API, and get back reliable, enriched, and structured data—no need to build or maintain your own pipeline. Use the results to power semantic search, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), analytics, or any workflow that needs high-quality data.

Whether you’re building legal, financial, healthcare, or enterprise AI products, Ingestor lets you focus on your application—not on document plumbing.
